# Underwater Color Correction Protocol for Digital Reef Images

## Overview  
The scripts in this repository accompany a protocol for color correcting digital underwater reef images obtained by the [Connolly Lab](https://striresearch.si.edu/connolly-lab/).  

The purpose of these scripts is to produce reef images free from water distortion. Inconsistent water conditions vary the color of coral, making it challenging to establish a standard color threshold for bleached coral. This protocol applies underwater colorimetry methods to correct water’s effect on reef colors and addresses this issue.
