# Underwater Color Correction Protocol for Digital Reef Images

The scripts in this repository acompany a protocol for color correcting digital underwater reef images obtained by the [Connolly Lab](https://striresearch.si.edu/connolly-lab/). 

The purpose of these scripts are to produce reef images free from water distortion. Inconsistent water conditions vary the color of coral. This makes it challenging to establish a standard color threshold for bleached coral, thus making it difficult to compare bleaching rates across time and sites. The scripts in this protocol apply underwater colorimetry methods to correct water's effect on true reef colors and adresses this issue. 



The following code and protocol in this repository was developed through a collaboration between the COLOR Lab and the Connolly
Lab, combining scripts and methods developed by Richard Montes Lemus with resources adapted
from Dr. Derya Akkaynak’s Underwater Colorimetry course at the Interuniversity Institute for Ma-
rine Sciences in Eilat, Israel.
