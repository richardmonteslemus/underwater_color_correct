# camera-pipeline-nonUI
Example for non-UI implementation of [**camera-pipeline-UI**](https://github.com/karaimer/camera-pipeline-UI). 

In this example, dng images under the folder **test** are rendered until the demosaicing stage, and until the end of the camera pipeline. 

Once **main.m** is run, demosaiced images will be placed under the folder **test/stage4**, and their corressponding images at the end of the pipeline will be placed under the folder **test/stage11**.
